# Hybrid-Feature-Pyramid-Attention-and-Capsule-Network-FPANet-CAPSNet-for-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation
, in the present research, to overcome these challenges, we propose to use a new model, known as Feature Pyramid Attention Network (FPANet) integrated with Capsule Networks (Caps Net) for efficient segmentation of gliomas in the BraTS 2020 dataset
